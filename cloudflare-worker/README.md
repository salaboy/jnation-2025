### Commands for local development

Install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

Run the db setup script:
```sh
# this is a convenience script that runs db:touch, db:generate, db:migrate, and db:seed
pnpm db:setup
```

Run the development server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

As you iterate on the database schema, you'll need to generate a new migration file and apply it like so:

```sh
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
```

### Commands for deployment

Before deploying your worker to Cloudflare, ensure that you have a running D1 instance on Cloudflare to connect your worker to.

You can create a D1 instance by navigating to the `Workers & Pages` section and selecting `D1 SQL Database.`

Alternatively, you can create a D1 instance using the CLI:

```sh
npx wrangler d1 create <database-name>
```

After creating the database, update the `wrangler.toml` file with the database id.

```toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "honc-d1-database"
database_id = "<database-id-you-just-created>"
migrations_dir = "drizzle/migrations"
```

Include the following information in a `.prod.vars` file:

```sh
CLOUDFLARE_D1_TOKEN="" # An API token with D1 edit permissions. You can create API tokens from your Cloudflare profile
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID="" # Find your Account id on the Workers & Pages overview (upper right)
CLOUDFLARE_DATABASE_ID="" # Find the database ID under workers & pages under D1 SQL Database and by selecting the created database
```

If you havenâ€™t generated the latest migration files yet, run:
```shell
npm run db:generate
```

Afterwards, run the migration script for production:
```shell
npm run db:migrate:prod
```

Change the name of the project in `wrangler.toml` to something appropriate for your project:

```toml
name = "my-d1-project"
```

Finally, deploy your worker

```shell 
npm run deploy
```
